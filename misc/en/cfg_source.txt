=================================
NSOD supports several different "sources", which are methods of getting a secret into the hooked process.

These sources are listed below, with some of their pros and cons:

    (1): Environment Variable: The program will retrieve the secret from the specified environment variable.
        [+] Simple.
        [-] Vulnerable to being leaked in some situations.

    (2): HashiCorp Vault Client: The process creates a Vault client with specified configuration, retrieves Vault credentials from other sources, then attempts to retrieve the secret from Vault.
        [+] Extremely secure.
        [+] Easy rotation of secrets.
        [-] Complex configuration with poor error handling if config is bad.
        [-] Slow, especially if secrets are accessed many times.
        [-] Failing to retrieve the secret results in a crash.

    (3): File: The process gets the data from an arbitrary file.
        [+] Allows using ephemeral filesystems that store their data in RAM.
        [-] Slower than a standard open() or using a symlink.
        [-] Security requires underlying filesystem support: may not be useful in some containers.
