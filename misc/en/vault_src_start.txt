=================================
Setting vault as a source requires more complex configuration than the other sources.
First, you will be asked for, in order:

    1. The address of the Vault server.
    2. Whether to verify responses (true/false).
    3. (Optional) Timeout (seconds).
    4. (Optional) Vault namespace.
    5. The secret engine to use (AWS and KV1/2 are supported).
    6. Vault mount: used for login and request.

Next, you will input the information needed to get your secret out of the Vault.
This varies based on the secret engine:

    AWS:
        1. Access key.
        2. Secret key.

    KV1:
        1. Path.
        2. Key.

    KV2:
        1. Path.

Finally, you will select a method of Vault authentication (identity or token) and provide an NSOD source for that credential.

DO NOT ENTER CREDENTIALS INTO ANY OF THESE PROMPTS!
