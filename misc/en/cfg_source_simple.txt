=================================
NSOD supports several different "sources", which are methods of getting a secret into the hooked process.

This source is required for HashiCorp Vault credentials, so Vault itself is not avaliable!!

If you want to source Vault credentials from a different Vault,
please do so externally and use one of the sources below to pipe them in.

These sources are listed below, with some of their pros and cons:

    (1): Environment Variable: The program will retrieve the secret from the specified environment variable.
        [+] Simple.
        [-] Vulnerable to being leaked in some situations.

    (2): File: The process gets the data from an arbitrary file.
        [+] Allows using ephemeral filesystems that store their data in RAM.
        [-] Slower than a standard open() or using a symlink.
        [-] Security requires underlying filesystem support: may not be useful in some containers.

Please select a source for the selected credential:
