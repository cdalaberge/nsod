=================================
NSOD can authenticate with Vault using either an *Identity* or a *Token*:

    (1): Identity: You provide a Vault identity consisting of an X509 Certificate and a private key. NSOD obtains a new session token each time a secret is requested.
        [+] Process can run indefinately as long as identity is valid.
        [+] No external Vault interaction required.
        [-] Very slow, many redundant requests, especially if the same secret is accessed multiple times.

    (2): Token: Prior to starting the process, you obtain a token from Vault. NSOD uses this token for the entire duration of the process.
        [+] Token can have as many or as few permissions as you want.
        [+] Faster, especially if many requests are made in a short time.
        [+] Ephemeral: the process never has access to credentials without a fixed lifespan.
        [-] Requires more work from the user.
        [-] Process cannot obtain new tokens at runtime, so if a token expires, the process will be forced to crash if that token is used.

Select (1) or (2):
