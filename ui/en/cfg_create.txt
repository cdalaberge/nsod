=================================
Please enter a name for this configuration (alphanumerics only).
The name of the binary you are going to hook often works well, e.g. "nginx" or "nginx_cfg_1".

This will be used to create two files in ~/.nsod:
    [name]_inject.json -> Data that is injected into the hooked process.
    [name]_wrapper.json -> Data that is used by the NSOD wrapper while launching the hooked process.

Do not put secrets in either of these files!
